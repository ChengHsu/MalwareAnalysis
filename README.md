# Malware Analysis & Classification

## Objective

Malware is constantly evolving in a fast-paced technological society and now encompasses a wide range of attack vectors that were not a concern a decade ago. As a result, in order to keep in pace with the advancement of technology, it is imperative that analysis and detection of malware follows the same trend. The purpose of this study is to discover if there are any underlying relationships or trends between different malware families.

## Approach Used

- Malware samples collected from Cuckoo Web Interface
- Static and Dynamic features extracted
- Static, Dynamic and Hybrid dataset constructed
- Supervised Leanring models(**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks**) applied on all 3 datasets to build and train the classifiers
- Grid search for optimal parameters

## Evaluation

- Static analysis: 82% at best
- Dynamic analysis: 79% at best
- Hybrid analysis: 87% at best

`Best Performer`: Neural Network with 2 hidden layers 

`Best Approach`: Hybrid Analysis

## Future Work 
Expand dataset: May help improve performance values
